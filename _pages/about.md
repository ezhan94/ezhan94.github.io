# About Me

I am a PhD Candidate at Caltech advised by [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/). I graduated from Cornell University with a bachelor's degree double majoring in computer science and mathematics. 

My research focuses on generative behavior modeling, particularly for domains where tracking data is readily available such as sports, animal tracking, and autonomous driving. 

# ICML 2020 Demo
